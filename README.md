## Challenges

</div>

As one can tell, this app is very much still the works. React, in and of itself, was a very challenging concept to get used to for me and I still have a long ways to go in terms of learning all the inner workings. That being said, however, I'm confident to say that I still feel like I learned a great amount from this project, and I'm even more motivated than before to want to grow as a React developer.

- [ ] Ensure that only posts are edited/deleted by the users that made them.
